\chapter{Installation}

\section{Required Libraries and Tools}

We run \glc\ on \href{http://fedoraproject.org/}{Fedora} Linux primarily. Installation instructions below are general, but we give some examples that are specific to Fedora (they probably work on other \href{http://yum.baseurl.org/}{{\tt yum}}-based Linux distributions though). For other distributions/OSs you'll need to figure out how to install pre-built packages or else install from source. Items marked with a ``$\star$'' are required to compile and run \glc. Others are only needed for some of the analysis and post-processing scripts so can be ignored it you don't want to use those.

\begin{description}
 \item [Perl] $\star$ The Perl language is a part of every Linux distribution that we know of, so use whatever method your distribution prefers to install it if you don't already have it. On Fedora the following (as root) will install Perl:
\begin{verbatim}
yum install perl perl-CPAN
\end{verbatim}
 If you need to install from source visit \href{http://www.perl.org/}{\tt http://www.perl.org/} and follow the instructions given there. We currently use Perl v5.10.0. \glc\ requires some Perl modules which probably are not installed by default. We recommend that you install these via \href{http://www.cpan.org/}{CPAN} (which probably is installed by default). The following modules should be installed.

It supports creation and automatic de-referencing of HDF5 region references and also supports reading of numerical attributes and 1-D attribute arrays.}. It is used by analysis scripts to extract data from \glc\ output files. Follow the following instructions (as root) to install this module:
\begin{verbatim}
 wget http://www.ctcp.caltech.edu/galacticus/tools/PDL-IO-HDF5-0.6.tar.gz

 cd PDL-IO-HDF5-0.6
 perl Makefile.PL
 make
 make test
 make install
\end{verbatim}
\end{description}

\item[Gnuplot] The \href{http://www.gnuplot.info/}{\sc Gnuplot} plotting package is used extensively by \glc\ to produce plots. While not required for running \glc\ it is recommended as it allows you to easily check model results using the preexisting plotting scripts. On Fedora the following (as root) will install {\tt Gnuplot}:
\begin{verbatim}
yum install gnuplot
\end{verbatim}
Alternatively, {\sc Gnuplot} can be installed from source, following the online instructions. Note that some scripts require {\sc Gnuplot} v4.4 or later. Some plotting scripts also make use of the {\tt Graphics::GnuplotIF} Perl module. This can be installed from CPAN using
\begin{verbatim}
perl -MCPAN -e 'install Graphics::GnuplotIF'
\end{verbatim}

\item[GraphViz] The \href{http://www.graphviz.org/}{GraphViz} package is used to create plots of merger tree structures. While not required to run \glc\ it is recommended to allow simple graphing of such structures (useful to get a visual impression of what's going on in the code). On Fedora the following (as root) will install GraphViz and a module that allows Perl to interact with it:
\begin{verbatim}
yum install graphviz perl-GraphViz
\end{verbatim}
Alternatively, GraphViz can be installed from source, following the online instructions, while the Perl module can be installed from CPAN using
\begin{verbatim}
perl -MCPAN -e 'install GraphViz'
\end{verbatim}

 \item [GNU Scientific Library] $\star$ The \href{http://www.gnu.org/software/gsl/}{GNU Scientific Library} (GSL) is used extensively by \glc\ to perform numerous numerical functions. We currently use v1.13 or v1.14 of GSL---other versions may or may not work. On Fedora the following (as root) will install GSL:
\begin{verbatim}
yum install gsl gsl-devel
\end{verbatim}
Alternatively, GSL can be downloaded and installed from source as described online.

 \item [GNU Make] $\star$ \glc\ uses \href{http://www.gnu.org/software/make/}{GNU Make} to build executables. Other implementations of {\tt make} may work, but we make no guarantees. On Fedora the following (as root) will install GNU Make:
\begin{verbatim}
yum install make
\end{verbatim}
Alternatively, GNU Make can be downloaded and installed from source as described online.

 \item [GFortran] $\star$ \glc\ is written in Fortran using various aspects of the Fortran 2003 specification. We use \href{http://gcc.gnu.org/fortran/}{GNU Fortran} to compile \glc. You can use other Fortran compilers, but we make no claims as to whether they will support all required features of the Fortran language, or that they will produce correctly working code. On Fedora the following (as root) will install GNU Fortran:
\begin{verbatim}
yum install gcc-gfortran
\end{verbatim}
Alternatively, GNU Fortran can be downloaded and installed from source as described online. Note that \glc\ requires v4.4 or higher of {\tt gcc-gfortran}. On some systems (e.g. RHEL5) this is available in package {\tt gcc44-gfortran}.

 \item [FoX] $\star$ \href{http://uszla.me.uk/space/software/FoX/}{FoX} is an XML parser for Fortran. The source can be downloaded from the link above\footnote{Alternatively, the source can be downloaded from \href{http://www.ctcp.caltech.edu/galacticus/tools/FoX-4.0.4-full.tar.gz}{\tt http://www.ctcp.caltech.edu/galacticus/tools/FoX-4.0.4-full.tar.gz}, since the FoX website is frequently down.}. We recommend following the instructions provided with the download for install. We use FoX v4.0.4.

 \item [HDF5] $\star$ The \href{http://hdf4.org/HDF5/}{HDF5} specification is used for storing output data from \glc. We currently use HDF5\footnote{Early versions of HDF5 may work, but versions prior to v1.8.5 have known memory leak problems.} v1.8.5.patch1. On Fedora the following (as root) will install the HDF5 libraries:
\begin{verbatim}
yum install hdf5 hdf5-devel
\end{verbatim}
Alternatively, HDF5 can be downloaded and installed from source. If this is done, we recommend the following build sequence:
\begin{verbatim}
 F9X=gfortran
 export F9X
 ./configure --prefix=/usr/local --enable-fortran --enable-production
 make
 make check
 make install
\end{verbatim}

 \item [FGSL] $\star$ \href{http://www.lrz-muenchen.de/services/software/mathematik/gsl/fortran/}{FGSL} is a Fortran interface to the GNU Scientific Library and is used extensively by \glc. It can be downloaded from the link above. We use FGSL v0.9.2\footnote{Note that if you use v1.14 of the GNU Scientific Library you should used FGSL v0.9.3 instead.} and recommend the following build sequence. 
\begin{verbatim}
 ./configure --f90 gfortran
 make
 make install
\end{verbatim}

\end{description}

\section{Compiling Galacticus}

To build \glc\ (after installing all required libraries) ensure that you are in the {\tt Galacticus/v0.0.1} directory and then simply type:
\begin{verbatim}
 make Galacticus.exe
\end{verbatim}
This will create the {\tt Galacticus.exe} executable. The build takes some time, you'll see a set of XML files get created first which \glc\ uses to figure out how modules link in to the \glc\ code. After that, the Fortran files are compiled. We regularly build \glc\ using a parallel make without any problems.

The {\tt Makefile} contains a few options that you may want to adjust:
\begin{description}
 \item[{\tt F03COMPILER}] The command to invoke a Fortran 2003 compliant compiler. \glc\ should compile with any such compiler. In practice, we have only\footnote{{\sc GFortran} v4.5 seems to have problems compiling \glc. {\sc GFortran} v4.6 has additional functionality which means that it will not accept the syntax used by \glc\ at present. However v4.6 has better OpenMP support and will eventually become the default compiler forglc\ once it reaches a stable release.} tried it using {\sc GFortran} v4.4. In particular, \glc\ makes use of certain Fortran 2003 features (notably procedure pointers and type-bound procedures) which older compilers might not handle (and some newer compilers might still have difficulty with);
 \item[{\tt PREPROCESSOR}] The command to invoke a preprocessor to handle {\tt \#IFDEF} etc. statements. We normally use {\tt cpp};
 \item[{\tt MODULETYPE}] A label identifying the structure of modules built by the compiler. This is used to detected when module interfaces have been changed (requiring a recompile of all dependent code) and when only the module internals have changed. When the {\sc GFortran} compiler is used {\tt GCC-f95-on-LINUX} should be used here. Look in {\tt ./scripts/build/Compare\_Module\_Files.pl} for other possibilities (if your compiler isn't listed you'll need to either edit that script or deal with longer recompiles if you edit the code).
 \item[{\tt F03FLAGS}] Flags to pass to the Fortran compiler. Standard options for both error-checking and optimized builds for the {\sc GFortran} compiler are given in the {\tt Makefile}.
\end{description}
Additionally, you can add compiler options to the {\tt GALACTICUS\_FLAGS} environment variable. This is useful to add machine-specific options.

\subsection{Compiling with OpenMP Parallelism}\index{OpenMP}\index{parallel}

By default, \glc\ will be compiled to run in parallel on machine with multiple CPUs using \href{http://openmp.org/wp/}{OpenMP}. To disable this simply remove (or comment out the)
\begin{verbatim}
F03FLAGS += -fopenmp
\end{verbatim}
line in the Makefile. When running \glc\ in parallel using OpenMP it may be necessary to increase the stack size allocated to each thread (since \glc\ calls some procedures recursively this can result in large numbers of local variables being allocated on the stack). To do this, use
\begin{verbatim}
setenv KMP_STACKSIZE 16777216
\end{verbatim}
in {\tt csh} and variants or
\begin{verbatim}
export KMP_STACKSIZE=16777216
\end{verbatim}
in {\tt bash} and variants. If you get stack overflows while running \glc\ in parallel, try increasing this value further.

\glc\ currently implements parallel calculations at the tree level---that is, each parallel thread works on a separate merger tree. This means that you need sufficient memory to hold multiple merger trees at once. The advantage of this approach is that it is highly scalable (assuming no need for communication between trees), and \glc\ can achieve close to optimal speed-up in many cases. The limit to the speed-up is usually determined by the workload balance between the trees. If one tree requires significantly more time to run that all other trees combined then one thread will be left working on that tree while all others have finished. To limit this problem, it is recommended that parallel runs which use {\tt mergerTreeConstructMethod}$=${\tt build} (see \S{sec:MergerTreeConstruction}) be conducted with the {\tt [mergerTreeBuildTreesProcessDescending]}$=${\tt true} parameter set to true. This will cause the most massive merger trees (i.e. those which take longest to process) to be processed first.

\section{Installing Without Root Access}

It is possible to install \glc\ without root access to your computer. The following approach has worked in many cases---some adjustments may be required for your specific system. Depending on what is already installed on your system, you may be able to skip some of the following installs. (Or, alternatively, you may need to install additional tools.) Choose a location to install that has at least 4Gb of free space. In the following, this install location is referred to as {\tt /your/install/path}.
