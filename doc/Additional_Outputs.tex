\chapter{Additional Output Quantities}

\section{Merger Tree Links}\index{merger tree!links}

The following properties are output to permit the merger tree structure to be recovered:
\begin{description}
 \item [{\tt nodeIndex}] A unique (within a tree) integer index identifying the node;
 \item [{\tt childIndex}] The index of this node's primary child node (or $-1$ if it has no child);
 \item [{\tt parentIndex}] The index of this node's parent node (or $-1$ if it has no parent);
 \item [{\tt siblingIndex}] The index of this node's sibling node (or $-1$ if it has no sibling);
 \item [{\tt satelliteIndex}] The index of this node's first satellite node (or $-1$ if it has no satellites);
\end{description}

\section{Virial Quantities}\index{virial}

The following quantities related to the virialized region of each node are output if {\tt outputVirialData} is set to true:
\begin{description}
 \item [{\tt nodeVirialRadius}] The virial radius (following whatever definition of virial overdensity was selected in \glc) in units of Mpc;
 \item [{\tt nodeVirialVelocity}] The circular velocity at the virial radius (in km/s).
\end{description}
