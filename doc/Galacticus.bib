	abstract = {We use the Millennium Simulation, a large, high-resolution N-body
simulation of the evolution of structure in a Λ cold dark matter
cosmology, to study the properties and fate of substructures within a
large sample of dark matter haloes. We find that the subhalo mass
function departs significantly from a power law at the high-mass end. We
also find that the radial and angular distributions of substructures
depend on subhalo mass. In particular, high-mass subhaloes tend to be
less radially concentrated and to have angular distributions closer to
the direction perpendicular to the spin of the host halo than their less
massive counterparts. We find that mergers between subhaloes occur.
These tend to be between substructures that were already dynamically
associated before accretion into the main halo. For subhaloes larger
than 0.001 times the mass of the host halo, it is more likely that the
subhalo will merge with the central or main subhalo than with another
subhalo larger than itself. For lower masses, subhalo-subhalo mergers
become equally likely to mergers with the main subhalo. Our results have
implications for the variation of galaxy properties with environment and
for the treatment of mergers in galaxy formation models.},

	volume = {397},
	url = {http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2009MNRAS.397.1302B},
	abstract = {Unbound outflows in the form of highly collimated jets and broad winds
appear to be a ubiquitous feature of accreting black hole systems. The
most powerful jets are thought to derive a significant fraction, if not
the majority, of their power from the rotational energy of the black
hole. Whatever the precise mechanism that causes them, these jets must,
therefore, exert a braking torque on the black hole. Consequently, we
expect jet production to play a significant role in limiting the maximum
spin attainable by accreting black holes. We calculate the spin-up
function - the rate of change of black hole spin normalized to the black
hole mass and accretion rate - for an accreting black hole, accounting
for this braking torque. We assume that the accretion flow on to a Kerr
black hole is advection-dominated {(ADAF)} and construct easy-to-use
analytic fits to describe the global structure of such flows based on
the numerical solutions of Popham \& Gammie. We find that the
predicted black hole spin-up function depends only on the black hole
spin and dimensionless parameters describing the accretion flow. Using
recent relativistic magnetohydrodynamical {(MHD)} numerical simulation
results to calibrate the efficiency of angular momentum transfer in the
flow, we find that an {ADAF} flow will spin a black hole up (or down) to
an equilibrium value of about 96 per cent of the maximal spin value in
the absence of jets. Combining our {ADAF} system with a simple model for
jet power, we demonstrate that an equilibrium is reached at
approximately 93 per cent of the maximal spin value, as found in the
numerical simulation studies of the spin-up of accreting black holes, at
which point the spin-up of the hole by accreted material is balanced by
the braking torque arising from jet production. The existence of
equilibrium spin means that optically dim active galactic nuclei {(AGNs)}
that have grown via accretion from an advection-dominated flow will not
be maximally rotating. It also offers a possible explanation for the
tight correlation observed by Allen et al. between the Bondi accretion
rate and jet power in nine, nearby, X-ray luminous giant elliptical
galaxies. We suggest that the black holes in these galaxies must all be
rotating close to their equilibrium value. Our model also yields a
relationship between jet efficiency and black hole spin that is in
surprisingly good agreement with that seen in the simulation studies,
indicating that our simple model is a useful and convenient description
of {ADAF} inflow - jet outflow about a spinning black hole for
incorporation in semi-analytic modelling as well as cosmological
numerical simulation studies focusing on the formation and evolution of
galaxies, groups and clusters of galaxies.},

assumptions made by this (and most other) semi-analytic models. This
allows it to be exploited reliably in high-redshift and low mass

parameter space to find a particular set of model parameters which
produce results in good agreement with a wide range of observational

	abstract = {We use a self-consistent model of galaxy formation and the evolution of the intergalactic medium to study the effects of the reionization of the Universe at high redshift on the properties of satellite galaxies like those seen around the Milky Way. Photoionization suppresses the formation of small galaxies, so that surviving satellites are preferentially those that formed before the Universe reionized. As a result, the number of satellites expected today is about an order of magnitude smaller than the number inferred by identifying satellites with subhaloes of the same circular velocity in high-resolution simulations of the dark matter. The resulting satellite population has an abundance similar to that observed in the Local Group, although the distribution of circular velocities differs somewhat from the available data. We explore many other properties of satellite galaxies, including their gas content, metallicity and star formation rate, and find generally good agreement with available data. Our model predicts the existence of many as yet undetected satellites in the Local Group. We quantify their observability in terms of their apparent magnitude and surface brightness, and also in terms of their constituent stars. A near-complete census of the Milky Way's satellites would require imaging to V{\textasciitilde}20 and to a surface brightness fainter than 26 V-band magnitudes per square arcsecond. Satellites with integrated luminosity V=15 should contain of order 100 stars brighter than B=26, with central stellar densities of a few tens per square arcminute. Discovery of a large population of faint satellites would provide a strong test of current models of galaxy formation.},

	abstract = {We investigate the spins and shapes of over a million dark matter haloes identified at z = 0 in the Millennium simulation. Our sample spans halo masses ranging from dwarf galaxies to rich galaxy clusters. The very large dynamic range of this Lambda cold dark matter cosmological simulation enables the distribution of spins and shapes and their variation with halo mass and environment to be characterized with unprecedented precision. We compare results for haloes identified using three different algorithms, and investigate (and remove) biases in the estimate of angular momentum introduced both by the algorithm itself and by numerical effects. We introduce a novel halo definition called the {TREE} halo, based on the branches of the halo merger trees, which is more appropriate for comparison with real astronomical objects than the traditional `friends-of-friends' and `spherical overdensity' {(SO)} algorithms. We find that for this many objects, the traditional lognormal function is no longer an adequate description of the distribution, P(lambda), of the dimensionless spin parameter lambda, and we provide a different function that gives a better fit for {TREE} and {SO} haloes. The variation in spin with halo mass is weak but detectable, although the trend depends strongly on the halo definition used. For the entire population of haloes, we find median values of lambdamed = 0.0367-0.0429, depending on the definition of a halo. The haloes exhibit a range of shapes, with a preference for prolateness over oblateness. More-massive haloes tend to be less spherical and more prolate. We find that the more-spherical haloes have less coherent rotation in the median, and those closest to being spherical have a spin independent of mass (lambdamed {\textbackslash}textasciitilde 0.033). The most-massive haloes have a spin independent of shape (lambdamed {\textbackslash}textasciitilde 0.032). The majority of haloes have their angular momentum vector aligned with their minor axis and perpendicular to their major axis. We find a general trend for higher spin haloes to be more clustered, with a stronger effect for more-massive haloes. For galaxy cluster haloes, this can be larger than a factor of {\textbackslash}textasciitilde2.},

	abstract = {We present a method that self-consistently tracks the growth of
supermassive black holes {(BHs)} and the feedback from active galactic
nuclei {(AGN)} in cosmological, hydrodynamical simulations. Our model is a
substantially modified version of the one introduced by Springel, Di
Matteo \& Hernquist implemented in a significantly expanded version
of the {GADGET} {III} code, which contains new prescriptions for star
formation, supernova feedback, radiative cooling and chemodynamics. We
simulate the growth of {BHs} from an initial seed state via
Eddington-limited accretion of the surrounding gas, and via mergers with
other {BHs.} Because cosmological simulations at present lack both the
resolution and the physics to model the multiphase interstellar medium,
they tend to strongly underestimate the {Bondi-Hoyle} accretion rate. To
allow low-mass {BHs} to grow, it is therefore necessary to increase the
predicted {Bondi-Hoyle} rates in star-forming gas by large factors, either
by explicitly multiplying the accretion rate by a numerical correction
factor or by using an unresolved, subgrid model for the gas close to the
{BH.} We explore the physical regimes where the use of such multiplicative
factors is reasonable, and through this introduce a new prescription for
gas accretion by {BHs.} Feedback from {AGN} is modelled by coupling a
fraction of the rest-mass energy of the accreted gas thermally into the
surrounding medium. We describe the implementation as well as the
limitations of the model in detail and motivate all the changes relative
to previous work. We demonstrate how general physical considerations can
be used to choose many of the parameters of the model and demonstrate
that the fiducial model reproduces observational constraints.

We employ a large suite of cosmological simulations, in which the
parameters of the {BH} model are varied away from their fiducial values,
to investigate the robustness of the predictions for the cosmic star
formation history and the redshift zero cosmic {BH} density, {BH} scaling
relations and galaxy-specific star formation rates. We find that the
freedom introduced by the need to increase the predicted accretion rates
by hand, the standard procedure in the literature, is the most
significant source of uncertainty. Our simulations demonstrate that
supermassive {BHs} are able to regulate their growth by releasing a fixed
amount of energy for a given halo mass, independent of the assumed
efficiency of {AGN} feedback, which sets the normalization of the {BH}
scaling relations. Regardless of whether {BH} seeds are initially placed
above or below the {BH} scaling relations, they grow on to the same
scaling relations. {AGN} feedback efficiently suppresses star formation in
high-mass galaxies.},

	abstract = {The time-scale for galaxies within merging dark matter haloes to merge with each other is an important ingredient in galaxy formation models. Accurate estimates of merging time-scales are required for predictions of astrophysical quantities such as black hole binary merger rates, the build-up of stellar mass in central galaxies and the statistical properties of satellite galaxies within dark matter haloes. In this paper, we study the merging time-scales of extended dark matter haloes using N-body simulations. We compare these results to standard estimates based on the Chandrasekhar theory of dynamical friction. We find that these standard predictions for merging time-scales, which are often used in semi-analytic galaxy formation models, are systematically shorter than those found in simulations. The discrepancy is approximately a factor of 1.7 for {Msat/Mhost} {\textbackslash}textasciitilde 0.1 and becomes larger for more disparate satellite-to-host mass ratios, reaching a factor of {\textbackslash}textasciitilde3.3 for {Msat/Mhost} {\textbackslash}textasciitilde 0.01. Based on our simulations, we propose a new, easily implementable fitting formula that accurately predicts the time-scale for an extended satellite to sink from the virial radius of a host halo down to the halo's centre for a wide range of {Msat/Mhost} and orbits. Including a central bulge in each galaxy changes the merging time-scale by {\textbackslash}textless{\textbackslash}textasciitilde10 per cent. To highlight one concrete application of our results, we show that merging time-scales often used in the literature overestimate the growth of stellar mass by satellite accretion by {\textbackslash}textasciitilde40 per cent, with the extra mass gained in low mass ratio mergers.},

The model employs a new Monte Carlo algorithm to follow the merging evolution of dark matter haloes with arbitrary mass resolution. It incorporates realistic descriptions of the density profiles of dark matter haloes and the gas they contain; it follows the chemical evolution of gas and stars, and the associated production of dust; and it includes a detailed calculation of the sizes of discs and spheroids. Wherever possible, our prescriptions for modelling individual physical processes are based on results of numerical simulations. They require a number of adjustable parameters, which we fix by reference to a small subset of local galaxy data. This results in a fully specified model of galaxy formation which can be tested against other data.

It is unclear whether these discrepancies represent fundamental shortcomings of the model, or whether they result from the various approximations and uncertainties inherent in the technique.

	abstract = {The stellar masses, mean ages, metallicities, and star formation
histories of galaxies are now commonly estimated via stellar population
synthesis {(SPS)} techniques. {SPS} relies on stellar evolution calculations
from the main sequence to stellar death, stellar spectral libraries,
phenomenological dust models, and stellar initial mass functions {(IMFs)}
to translate the evolution of a multimetallicity, multi-age set of stars
into a prediction for the time-evolution of the integrated light from
that set of stars. Each of these necessary inputs carries significant
uncertainties that have until now received little systematic attention.
The present work is the first in a series that explores the impact of
uncertainties in key phases of stellar evolution and the {IMF} on the
derived physical properties of galaxies and the expected luminosity
evolution for a passively evolving set of stars. A Monte Carlo Markov
Chain approach is taken to fit {near-UV} through {near-IR} photometry of a
representative sample of low- and high-redshift galaxies with this new
{SPS} model. Significant results include the following. (1) Including
uncertainties in stellar evolution, stellar masses at z {\textasciitilde} 0 carry errors
of {\textasciitilde}0.3 dex at 95\% {CL} with little dependence on luminosity or color,
while at z {\textasciitilde} 2, the masses of bright red galaxies are uncertain at the
{\textasciitilde}0.6 dex level. (2) Either current stellar evolution models, current
observational stellar libraries, or both, do not adequately characterize
the metallicity-dependence of the thermally pulsating {AGB} phase. (3)
Conservative estimates on the uncertainty of the slope of the {IMF} in the
solar neighborhood imply that luminosity evolution per unit redshift is
uncertain at the {\textasciitilde}0.4 mag level in the K band, which is a substantial
source of uncertainty for interpreting the evolution of galaxy
populations across time. Any possible evolution in the {IMF,} as suggested
by several independent lines of evidence, will only exacerbate this
problem. (4) Assuming a distribution of stellar metallicities within a
galaxy, rather than a fixed value as is usually assumed, can yield
important differences when considering bands blueward of V, but is not a
concern for redder bands. Spectroscopic information may alleviate some
of these concerns, though uncertainties in the stellar spectral
libraries and the importance of nonsolar abundance ratios have not yet
been systematically investigated in the {SPS} context.},

luminosity and surface brightness. The structural parameters of the
galaxies were corrected for internal extinction using a description
depending on galaxy surface brightness. We find that the bivariate space
density distribution of spiral galaxies in the (luminosity, scale
size)-plane is well described by a Schechter luminosity function in the
luminosity dimension and a log-normal scale-size distribution at a given
luminosity. This parameterization of the scale-size distribution was
motivated by a simple model for the formation of disks within dark
matter halos, with halos acquiring their angular momenta through tidal
torques from neighboring objects and the disk specific angular momentum
being proportional to that of the parent halo. However, the fractional
width of the scale-size distribution at a given luminosity is narrower
than what one would expect from using the distribution of angular
momenta of halos measured in N-body simulations of hierarchical
clustering. We present several possible explanations for the narrowness
of the observed distribution. Using our bivariate distribution, we find
that determinations of the local luminosity function of spiral galaxies
should not be strongly affected by the bias against low surface
brightness galaxies, even when the galaxies are selected from
photographic plates. This may not be true for studies at high redshift,

significant selection bias against lower surface brightness galaxies, if

host galaxies. The calculation is embedded in the {GALFORM}
semi-analytical model which simulates the formation and evolution of
galaxies in a cold dark matter {(CDM)} universe. During the evolution of
the host galaxy, hot and cold gas are added to the {SMBH} by flows
triggered by halo gas cooling, disc instabilities and galaxy mergers.
This builds up the mass and spin of the {BH,} and the resulting accretion
power regulates the gas cooling and subsequent star formation. The
accretion flow is assumed to form a geometrically thin cool disc when
the accretion rate exceeds {0.01{\textbackslash}dot{M}\_Edd,} and a geometrically thick,
radiatively inefficient hot flow when the accretion rate falls below
this value. The resulting quasar optical luminosity function matches
observations very well, and the mass of the {SMBH} correlates with the
mass of the galaxy bulge as observed. The {BH} spin distribution depends
strongly on whether the gas in any given accretion episode remains in
the same plane (prolonged accretion) or whether, due to self-gravity, it
fragments into multiple, randomly aligned accretion episodes (chaotic
accretion). In the chaotic accretion model there is a clear correlation
of spin with {SMBH} mass. Massive {BHs} {(M{\textgreater}5{\textbackslash}times10{\textasciicircum}8{\textbackslash}Msun)} are hosted
by giant elliptical galaxies and are rapidly spinning, while lower mass
{BHs} are hosted in spiral galaxies and have much lower spin. Using the
{Blandford-Znajek} mechanism for jet production to calculate the jet

The average r-band disk scale length is 3.79 kpc, with an {RMS} dispersion
of 2.05 kpc, and this is a typical value irrespective of passband and

lengths presented here are representative for a typical galaxy mass of

another. Such transformations could be used to test the results of

	abstract = {We use two very large cosmological simulations to study how the density profiles of relaxed Lambda cold dark matter dark haloes depend on redshift and on halo mass. We confirm that these profiles deviate slightly but systematically from the {NFW} form and are better approximated by the empirical formula, d logrho/d logr {\textbackslash}textasciitilde ralpha, first used by Einasto to fit star counts in the Milky Way. The best-fitting value of the additional shape parameter, alpha, increases gradually with mass, from alpha {\textbackslash}textasciitilde 0.16 for present-day galaxy haloes to alpha {\textbackslash}textasciitilde 0.3 for the rarest and most massive clusters. Halo concentrations depend only weakly on mass at z = 0, and this dependence weakens further at earlier times. At z {\textbackslash}textasciitilde 3 the average concentration of relaxed haloes does not vary appreciably over the mass range accessible to our simulations {(M} {\textbackslash}textgreater{\textbackslash}textasciitilde 3 � {1011h-1Msolar).} Furthermore, in our biggest simulation, the average concentration of the most massive, relaxed haloes is constant at 200{\textbackslash}textgreater {\textbackslash}textasciitilde 3.5-4 for 0 {\textbackslash}textless= z {\textbackslash}textless= 3. These results agree well with those of Zhao et al. and support the idea that halo densities reflect the density of the universe at the time they formed, as proposed by Navarro, Frenk \& White. With their original parameters, the {NFW} prescription overpredicts halo concentrations at high redshift. This shortcoming can be reduced by modifying the definition of halo formation time, although the evolution of the concentrations of Milky Way mass haloes is still not reproduced well. In contrast, the much-used revisions of the {NFW} prescription by Bullock et al. and Eke, Navarro \& Steinmetz predict a steeper drop in concentration at the highest masses and stronger evolution with redshift than are compatible with our numerical data. Modifying the parameters of these models can reduce the discrepancy at high masses, but the overly rapid redshift evolution remains. These results have important implications for currently planned surveys of distant clusters.},

	url = {http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2004ApJ...616...16G},
	abstract = {The cooling of gas in the centers of dark matter halos is expected to lead to a more concentrated dark matter distribution. The response of dark matter to the condensation of baryons is usually calculated using the model of adiabatic contraction, which assumes spherical symmetry and circular orbits. In contrast, halos in the hierarchical structure formation scenarios grow via multiple violent mergers and accretion along filaments, and particle orbits in the halos are highly eccentric. We study the effects of the cooling of gas in the inner regions of halos using high-resolution cosmological simulations that include gas dynamics, radiative cooling, and star formation. We find that the dissipation of gas indeed increases the density of dark matter and steepens its radial profile in the inner regions of halos compared to the case without cooling. For the first time, we test the adiabatic contraction model in cosmological simulations and find that the standard model systematically overpredicts the increase of dark matter density in the inner 5\% of the virial radius. We show that the model can be improved by a simple modification of the assumed invariant from M(r)r to M(r)r, where r and r are the current and orbit-averaged particle positions. This modification approximately accounts for orbital eccentricities of particles and reproduces simulation profiles to within 10\%-20\%. We present analytical fitting functions that accurately describe the transformation of the dark matter profile in the modified model and can be used for interpretation of observations.},

	abstract = {High resolution cosmological N-body simulations of four galaxy-scale dark matter halos are compared to corresponding N-body/hydrodynamical simulations containing dark matter, stars and gas. The simulations without baryons share features with others described in the literature in that the dark matter density slope continuously decreases towards the center, with a density {rhoDM∝r-1.3�0.2,} at about 1\% of the virial radius for our Milky Way sized galaxies. The central cusps in the simulations which also contain baryons steepen significantly, to {rhoDM∝r-1.9�0.2,} with an indication of the inner logarithmic slope converging. Models of adiabatic contraction of dark matter halos due to the central buildup of stellar/gaseous galaxies are examined. The simplest and most commonly used model, by Blumenthal et al., is shown to overestimate the central dark matter density considerably. A modified model proposed by Gnedin et al. is tested and it is shown that, while it is a considerable improvement, it is not perfect. Moreover, it is found that the contraction parameters in their model not only depend on the orbital structure of the dark-matter only halos but also on the stellar feedback prescription which is most relevant for the baryonic distribution. Implications for dark matter annihilation at the galactic center are discussed and it is found that, although our simulations show a considerable reduced dark matter halo contraction as compared to the Blumenthal et al. model, the fluxes from dark matter annihilation are still expected to be enhanced by at least a factor of a hundred, as compared to dark-matter only halos. Finally, it is shown that, while dark-matter only halos are typically prolate, the dark matter halos containing baryons are mildly oblate with minor-to-major axis ratios of c/a=0.73�0.11, with their flattening aligned with the central baryonic disks.},

	abstract = {Growing evidence suggests that the first generation of stars may have
been quite massive ({\textasciitilde}100-300 Msolar). Could these stars have
left a distinct nucleosynthetic signature? We explore the
nucleosynthesis of helium cores in the mass range {MHe=64-133}
Msolar, corresponding to main-sequence star masses of
approximately 140-260 Msolar. Above {MHe=133}
Msolar, without rotation and using current reaction rates, a
black hole is formed, and no nucleosynthesis is ejected. For lighter
helium core masses, {\textasciitilde}40-63 Msolar, violent pulsations occur,
induced by the pair instability and accompanied by supernova-like mass
ejection, but the star eventually produces a large iron core in
hydrostatic equilibrium. It is likely that this core, too, collapses to
a black hole, thus cleanly separating the heavy-element nucleosynthesis
of pair instability supernovae from those of other masses, both above
and below. Indeed, black hole formation is a likely outcome for all
Population {III} stars with main-sequence masses between about 25 and 140
Msolar {(MHe=9-63} Msolar) as well as
those above 260 Msolar. Nucleosynthesis in pair instability
supernovae varies greatly with the mass of the helium core. This core
determines the maximum temperature reached during the bounce. At the
upper range of exploding core masses, a maximum of 57 Msolar
of {56Ni} is produced, making these the most energetic and the
brightest thermonuclear explosions in the universe. Integrating over a
distribution of masses, we find that pair instability supernovae produce
a roughly solar distribution of nuclei having even nuclear charge {(Si,}
S, Ar, etc.) but are remarkably deficient in producing elements with odd
nuclear {charge-Na,} Al, P, V, Mn, etc. This is because there is no stage
of stable post-helium burning to set the neutron excess. Also,
essentially no elements heavier than zinc are produced owing to a lack
of s- and r-processes. The {Fe/Si} ratio is quite sensitive to whether the
upper bound on the initial mass function is over 260 Msolar
or somewhere between 140 and 260 Msolar. When the yields of
pair instability supernovae are combined with reasonable estimates of
the nucleosynthesis of Population {III} stars from 12 to 40
Msolar, this distinctive pattern of deficient production of
{odd-Z} elements persists. Some possible strategies for testing our
predictions are discussed.},

In contrast to Navarro et al., our numerical results indicate that the commonly used equation for the merger timescale given by Lacey and Cole systematically underestimates the merger timescales for minor mergers and overestimates those for major mergers. This behavior is partly explained by the poor performance of their expression for the Coulomb logarithm, ln(mpri/msat). The two alternative forms ln(1+mpri/msat) and 1/2ln[1+(mpri/msat)2] for the Coulomb logarithm can account for the mass dependence of merger timescale successfully, but both of them underestimate the merger timescale by a factor 2. Since ln(1+mpri/msat) represents the mass dependence slightly better, we adopt this expression for the Coulomb logarithm. Furthermore, we find that the dependence of the merger timescale on the circularity parameter ɛ is much weaker than the widely adopted power law ɛ0.78, whereas 0.94ɛ0.60+0.60 provides a good match to the data. Based on these findings, we present an accurate and convenient fitting formula for the merger timescale of galaxies in cold dark matter models.},

In low-mass {AGB} models we investigate the effect on the production of light elements of including some partial mixing of protons into the intershell region during the deepest extent of each third dredge-up episode.

ratio of the current star formation rate {(SFR)} to the average past rate
increases from of order 0.01 in Sa galaxies to 1 in {Sc-Irr} disks. This
confirms that the pronounced change in the photometric properties of
spiral galaxies along the Hubble sequence is predominantly due to
changes in the star formation histories of disks, and only secondarily
to changes in the bulge/disk ratio. A comparison of current {SFRs} and gas
masses of the sample yields median timescales for gas consumption of
approximately 3 Gyr, in the absence of stellar recycling. However, a
proper time-dependent treatment of the gas return from stars shows that
recycling extends the gas lifetimes of disks by factors of 1.5-4 for
typical disk parameters. Consequently the current {SFRs} in many (but not
all) disks can be sustained for periods comparable to the Hubble time.},

	abstract = {{(Abridged)} The 7-year {WMAP} data and improved astrophysical data
rigorously tests the standard cosmological model and its extensions. By
combining {WMAP} with the latest distance measurements from the Baryon
Acoustic Oscillations {(BAO)} and the Hubble constant {(H0)} measurement, we
determine the parameters of the simplest {LCDM} model. The power-law index
of the primordial power spectrum is n\_s=0.963+-0.012, a measurement that
excludes the scale-invariant spectrum by more than 3-sigma. The other
parameters, including those beyond the minimal set, are also improved
from the 5-year results. Notable examples of improved parameters are the
total mass of neutrinos, {sum(m\_nu){\textless}0.58eV,} and the effective number
of neutrino species, N\_eff=4.34+0.86-0.88, which benefit from better
determinations of the third peak and H0. We detect the effect of
primordial helium on the temperature power spectrum and provide a new
test of big bang nucleosynthesis. We detect, and show on the map for the
first time, the tangential and radial polarization patterns around hot
and cold spots of temperature fluctuations, an important test of
physical processes at z=1090 and the dominance of adiabatic scalar
fluctuations. With the 7-year {TB} power spectrum, the limit on a rotation
of the polarization plane due to potential parity-violating effects has
improved to Delta(alpha)=-1.1+-1.3(stat)+-1.5(syst) degrees. We report a
significant detection of the {SZ} effect at the locations of known
clusters, and show that the current simulations and analytical
calculations overestimate the gas pressure, and do not reproduce the
observed gas pressure in clusters of galaxies. This result is consistent
with the lower-than-expected {SZ} power spectrum recently measured by the
{SPT} collaboration.},

	abstract = {A universal initial mass function {(IMF)} is not intuitive, but so far no
convincing evidence for a variable {IMF} exists. The detection of
systematic variations of the {IMF} with star-forming conditions would be
the Rosetta Stone for star formation. In this contribution an average or
Galactic-field {IMF} is defined, stressing that there is evidence for a
change in the power-law index at only two masses: near
{0.5Msolar} and near {0.08Msolar.} Using this supposed
universal {IMF,} the uncertainty inherent in any observational estimate of
the {IMF} is investigated by studying the scatter introduced by Poisson
noise and the dynamical evolution of star clusters. It is found that
this apparent scatter reproduces quite well the observed scatter in
power-law index determinations, thus defining the fundamental limit
within which any true variation becomes undetectable. The absence of
evidence for a variable {IMF} means that any true variation of the {IMF} in
well-studied populations must be smaller than this scatter.
Determinations of the power-law indices α are subject to
systematic errors arising mostly from unresolved binaries. The
systematic bias is quantified here, with the result that the single-star
{IMFs} for young star clusters are systematically steeper by
Δα{\textasciitilde}0.5 between 0.1 and {1Msolar} than the
Galactic-field {IMF,} which is populated by, on average, about {5-Gyr-old}
stars. The {MFs} in globular clusters appear to be, on average,
systematically flatter than the Galactic-field {IMF} {(Piotto} \&
Zoccali; Paresce \& De Marchi), and the recent detection of ancient
white-dwarf candidates in the Galactic halo and the absence of
associated low-mass stars {(Ibata} et al.; Méndez \& Minniti)
suggest a radically different {IMF} for this ancient population. Star
formation in higher metallicity environments thus appears to produce
relatively more low-mass stars. While still tentative, this is an
interesting trend, being consistent with a systematic variation of the
{IMF} as expected from theoretical arguments.},

	abstract = {We investigate the metal enrichment of the intracluster medium {(ICM)}
within the framework of hierarchical models of galaxy formation. We
calculate the formation and evolution of galaxies and clusters using a
semi-analytical model which includes the effects of flows of gas and
metals both into and out of galaxies. For the first time in a
semi-analytical model, we calculate the production of both α and
iron-peak elements based on theoretical models for the lifetimes and
ejecta of type Ia and {II} supernovae {(SNe} Ia and {II).} It is essential to
include the long lifetimes of the {SNIa} progenitors in order to correctly
model the evolution of the iron-peak elements. We find that if all stars
form with an initial mass function {(IMF)} similar to that found in the
solar neighbourhood, then the metallicities of O, Mg, Si and Fe in the
{ICM} are predicted to be two to three times lower than the observed
values. In contrast, a model (also favoured on other grounds) in which
stars formed in bursts triggered by galaxy mergers have a top-heavy {IMF}
reproduces the observed {ICM} abundances of O, Mg, Si and Fe. The same
model predicts ratios of {ICM} mass to total stellar luminosity in
clusters which agree well with observations. According to our model, the
bulk of the metals in clusters are produced by L* and
brighter galaxies. We predict only mild evolution of {[Fe/H]} in the {ICM}
with redshift out to z{\textasciitilde} 1, consistent with the sparse data available on
high-z clusters. In contrast, the {[O/Fe]} ratio is predicted to gradually
decrease with time because of the delayed production of iron compared
with oxygen. We find that, at a given redshift, the scatter in global
metallicity for clusters of a given mass is quite small, even though the
formation histories of individual clusters show wide variations. The
observed diversity in {ICM} metallicities may thus result from the range
in metallicity gradients induced by the scatter in the assembly
histories of clusters of galaxies.},

The gas rotates at much less than the Keplerian angular velocity; therefore, the central stars in such flows will cease to spin up long before they reach the break-up limit. Further, the Bernoulli parameter is positive, implying that advection-dominated flows are susceptible to producing outflows. Convection is likely in many of these flows and, if present, will tend to enhance the above effects. We suggest that advection-dominated accretion may provide an explanation for the slow spin rates of accreting stars and the widespread occurence of outflows and jets in accreting systems.},

Among the most important are that no singularities at early times appear, which avoids numerical problems in particular in applications to cosmologies with dynamical and early dark energy, and that the assumption of time-reversal symmetry can easily be dropped where it is not strictly satisfied. We use this approach to derive the two parameters characterising the spherical-collapse model, i.e.{\textasciitilde}the linear density threshold for collapse \${\textbackslash}delta\_{\textbackslash}mathrm{c}\$ and the virial overdensity {\${\textbackslash}Delta\_{\textbackslash}mathrm{V}\$,} for a broad variety of dark-energy models and to reconsider these parameters in cosmologies with early dark energy.

velocity (the {Tully-Fisher} {[TF]} relation), in the g, r, i, and z bands,

Survey, with the goal of providing well-defined observational
constraints for theoretical models of galaxy formation. The input sample
of 234 galaxies has a roughly flat distribution of absolute magnitudes
in the range -18.5 {\textgreater} Mr {\textgreater} -22, and our only
morphological selection is an isophotal axis ratio cut b/a {\textless} 0.6 to
allow accurate inclination corrections. Long-slit spectroscopy from the
Calar Alto and {MDM} observatories yields usable Hα rotation curves
for 162 galaxies (69\%), with a representative color and morphology
distribution. We define circular velocities V80 by evaluating
the rotation curve at the radius containing 80\% of the i-band light.
Observational errors, including estimated distance errors due to
peculiar velocities, are small compared to the intrinsic scatter of the
{TF} relation. The slope of the forward {TF} relation steepens from -5.5
± 0.2 mag (log10 km s-1)-1 in
the g band to -6.6 ± 0.2 mag (log10 km
s-1)-1 in the z band. The intrinsic scatter is
σ approx 0.4 mag in all bands, and residuals from either the
forward or inverse relations have an approximately Gaussian
distribution. We discuss how Malmquist-type biases may affect the
observed slope, intercept, and scatter. The scatter is not dominated by
rare outliers or by any particular class of galaxies, although it drops
slightly, to σ approx 0.36 mag, if we restrict the sample to
nearly bulgeless systems. Correlations of {TF} residuals with other galaxy
properties are weak: bluer galaxies are significantly brighter than
average in the g-band {TF} relation but only marginally brighter in the i
band; more concentrated (earlier type) galaxies are slightly fainter
than average, and the {TF} residual is virtually independent of half-light
radius, contrary to the trend expected for gravitationally dominant
disks. The observed residual correlations do not account for most of the
intrinsic scatter, implying that this scatter is instead driven largely
by variations in the ratio of dark to luminous matter within the disk
galaxy population.},

	abstract = {Black holes grow by accreting matter from their surroundings. However, angular momentum provides an efficient natural barrier to accretion and so only the lowest angular momentum material will be available to feed the black holes. The standard modelling of black hole growth in galaxy formation simulations (based on the {Bondi-Hoyle} method) takes no account of the angular momentum of accreting material, and so it is unclear how representative the estimated accretion rates in these simulations are likely to be. In this paper we introduce a new method for estimating the black hole accretion rate {(dM/dt)\_BH} that explicitly accounts for the angular momentum of accreting material. We model both the black hole and its accretion disc as a composite accretion disc particle. Gas particles are accreted by the accretion disc particle if and only if their orbits bring them within its accretion radius R\_acc. The gas mass is then added to the accretion disc and is available to feed the black hole on a viscous timescale t\_visc. The resulting {(dM/dt)\_BH} powers the accretion luminosity L\_acc {\textasciitilde} {(dM/dt)\_BH,} which in turn drives feedback from the black hole. Through a series of controlled numerical experiments we demonstrate that our new accretion disc particle method is far more physically self-consistent than the {Bondi-Hoyle} method. We also discuss the physical implications of the accretion disc particle method for systems with a high degree of rotational support, and we argue that the {M\_BH-sigma} relation in these systems should be offset from the relation for classical bulges and ellipticals, as appears to be observed.},

	abstract = {Our heuristic understanding of the abundance of dark matter halos
centers around the concept of a density threshold, or "barrier," for
gravitational collapse. If one adopts the ansatz that regions of the
linearly evolved density field smoothed on mass scale M with an
overdensity that exceeds the barrier will undergo gravitational collapse
into halos of mass M, the corresponding abundance of such halos can be
estimated simply as a fraction of the mass density satisfying the
collapse criterion divided by the mass M. The key ingredient of this
ansatz is therefore the functional form of the collapse barrier as a
function of mass M or, equivalently, of the variance
{σ2(M).} Several such barriers based on the spherical,
Zel'dovich, and ellipsoidal collapse models have been extensively
discussed. Using large-scale cosmological simulations, we show that the
relation between the linear overdensity and the mass variance for
regions that collapse to form halos by the present epoch resembles
expectations from dynamical models of ellipsoidal collapse. However, we
also show that using such a collapse barrier with the excursion set
ansatz predicts a halo mass function inconsistent with that measured
directly in cosmological simulations. This inconsistency demonstrates a
failure of the excursion set ansatz as a physical model for halo
collapse. We discuss implications of our results for understanding the
collapse epoch for halos as a function of mass, and avenues for
improving consistency between analytical models for the collapse epoch
and the results of cosmological simulations.},

Sky Survey {(SDSS)} to study the size distribution of galaxies and its
dependence on their luminosity, stellar mass and morphological type. The
large {SDSS} data base provides statistics of unprecedented accuracy. For
each type of galaxy, the size distribution at given luminosity (or
stellar mass) is well described by a log-normal function, characterized
by its median and dispersion {σlnR.} For late-type
galaxies, there is a characteristic luminosity at Mr,0{\textasciitilde}-20.5
(assuming h= 0.7) corresponding to a stellar mass M0{\textasciitilde}
1010.6 Msolar. Galaxies more massive than
M0 have and {σlnR{\textasciitilde}} 0.3, while less massive
galaxies have and {σlnR{\textasciitilde}} 0.5. For early-type galaxies,
the relation is significantly steeper, , but the {σlnR-M}
relation is similar to that of bright late-type galaxies. Faint red
galaxies have sizes quite independent of their luminosities. We use
simple theoretical models to interpret these results. The observed
relation for late-type galaxies can be explained if the fraction of
baryons that form stars is as predicted by the standard feedback model.
Fitting the observed {σlnR-M} relation requires in
addition that the bulge/disc mass ratio be larger in haloes of lower
angular momentum and that the bulge material transfers part of its
angular momentum to the disc. This can be achieved if bulge formation
occurs so as to maintain a marginally stable disc. For early-type
galaxies, the observed {σlnR-M} relation is inconsistent
with formation through single major mergers of present-day discs. It is
consistent with formation through repeated mergers, if the progenitors
have properties similar to those of faint ellipticals or Lyman break
galaxies and merge from relatively strongly bound orbits.},

	abstract = {The {Press-Schechter,} excursion set approach allows one to make predictions about the shape and evolution of the mass function of bound objects. The approach combines the assumption that objects collapse spherically with the assumption that the initial density fluctuations were Gaussian and small. The predicted mass function is reasonably accurate, although it has fewer high-mass and more low-mass objects than are seen in simulations of hierarchical clustering. We show that the discrepancy between theory and simulation can be reduced substantially if bound structures are assumed to form from an ellipsoidal, rather than a spherical, collapse. In the original, standard, spherical model, a region collapses if the initial density within it exceeds a threshold value, deltasc. This value is independent of the initial size of the region, and since the mass of the collapsed object is related to its initial size, this means that deltasc is independent of final mass. In the ellipsoidal model, the collapse of a region depends on the surrounding shear field, as well as on its initial overdensity. In Gaussian random fields, the distribution of these quantities depends on the size of the region considered. Since the mass of a region is related to its initial size, there is a relation between the density threshold value required for collapse and the mass of the final object. We provide a fitting function to this deltaec(m) relation which simplifies the inclusion of ellipsoidal dynamics in the excursion set approach. We discuss the relation between the excursion set predictions and the halo distribution in high-resolution N-body simulations, and use our new formulation of the approach to show that our simple parametrization of the ellipsoidal collapse model represents an improvement on the spherical model on an object-by-object basis. Finally, we show that the associated statistical predictions, the mass function and the large-scale halo-to-mass bias relation, are also more accurate than the standard predictions.},

show that parameters such as the density and the metallicity of the
environment significantly influence the evolution of the remnant and
thus change its effects on the global environment (e.g., globular
clusters, galaxies) as a source of thermal and kinetic energy. We
conducted our studies using a one-dimensional hydrodynamics code, in
which we implemented a metallicity-dependent cooling function. Global
time-dependent quantities such as the total kinetic and thermal energies
and the radial extent are calculated for a grid of parameter sets. The
quantities calculated are the total energy, the kinetic energy, the
thermal energy, the radial extent, and the mass. We distinguished
between the hot, rarefied bubble and the cold, dense shell, since these
two phases are distinct in their roles in a gas-stellar system. We also
present power-law fits to those quantities as a function of
environmental parameters after the extensive cooling has ceased. The
power-law fits enable simple incorporation of improved supernova energy
input and matter redistribution (including the effect of the local
conditions) in galactic/globular cluster models. Our results for the
energetics of supernova remnants in the late stages of their expansion
give total energies ranging from {\textasciitilde}9 x 1049 to {\textasciitilde}3 x 1050 ergs, with a
typical case being {\textasciitilde}1050 ergs, depending on the surrounding environment.
About 8.5 x 1049 ergs of this energy can be found in the form of kinetic
energy. Supernovae play an important role in the evolution of the
interstellar medium and galaxies as a whole, providing mechanisms for
kinetic energy input and for phase transitions of the interstellar
medium. However, we have found that the total energy input per supernova
is about 1 order of magnitude smaller than the initial explosion energy.},

function, in the sense that the same functional form and parameters can
be used for different cosmologies and redshifts when expressed in
appropriate variables. In addition to our fitting formulae, our main
finding is that the mass function cannot be represented by a universal

To do this, we need to specify the density distribution and the velocity field which supports the disk. We first show that the required circular velocity has no dependence on the height above or below the midplane so long as the gas pressure is a function of density only. The assumption of disks being very thin enables us to decouple the vertical structure from the radial direction. Based on that, the equation of hydrostatic equilibrium together with the reduced Poisson equation leads to two sets of second-order non-linear differential equation, which are easily integrated to set-up a stable disk. We call one approach `density method' and the other one `potential method'. Gas disks in detailed balance are especially suitable for investigating the onset of the gravitational instability. We revisit the question of global, axisymmetric instability using fully three-dimensional disk simulations. The impact of disk thickness on the disk instability and the formation of spontaneously induced spirals is studied systematically with or without the presence of the stellar potential. In our models, the numerical results show that the threshold value for disk instability is shifted from unity to 0.69 for self-gravitating thick disks and to 0.75 for combined stellar and gas thick disks. The simulations also show that self-induced spirals occur in the correct regions and with the right numbers as predicted by the analytic theory.},

	abstract = {Using a large galaxy group catalogue constructed from the Sloan Digital
Sky Survey Data Release 2, we investigate the correlation between
various galaxy properties and halo mass. We split the population of
galaxies in early-types, late-types and intermediate-types, based on
their colour and specific star formation rate. At fixed luminosity, the
late- (early-)type fraction of galaxies increases (decreases) with
decreasing halo mass. Most importantly, this mass dependence is smooth
and persists over the entire mass range probed, without any break or
feature at any mass-scale. We argue that the previous claim of a
characteristic feature on galaxy group scales is an artefact of the
environment estimators used. At fixed halo mass, the luminosity
dependence of the type fractions is surprisingly weak, especially over
the range 0.25 {{\textless}{\textasciitilde}L/L*{\textless}{\textasciitilde}} 2.5: galaxy type depends more strongly on
halo mass than on luminosity. In agreement with previous studies, the
late- (early-)type fraction increases (decreases) with increasing
halocentric radius. However, we find that this radial dependence is
present in haloes of all masses probed (down to
{1012h-1Msolar),} while previous studies
did not find any radial dependence in haloes with M{\textless}{\textasciitilde}
{1013.5h-1Msolar.} We argue that this
discrepancy owes to the fact that we have excluded central galaxies from
our analysis. We also find that the properties of satellite galaxies are
strongly correlated with those of their central galaxy. In particular,
the early-type fraction of satellites is significantly higher in a halo
with an early-type central galaxy than in a halo of the same mass but
with a late-type central galaxy. This phenomenon, which we call
`galactic conformity', is present in haloes of all masses and for
satellites of all luminosities. Finally, the fraction of
intermediate-type galaxies is always {\textasciitilde}20 per cent, independent of
luminosity, independent of halo mass, independent of halocentric radius,
and independent of whether the galaxy is a central galaxy or a satellite
galaxy. We discuss the implications of all these findings for galaxy

the kinetic energy associated with random motions is higher in our
merger remnants which have high entropy floors, indicating the motions
have efficiently mixed the gas and heated the cluster core with gas of
